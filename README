===================================================
What are all the files about ?

zdata files
-----------

There are 4 "zdata" files.
Containing the specs of drivers, constructors, races and players.

all zdata files can have blank lines in them. Blank lines are ignored.

The zdata.drivers and zdata.constructors are 2 fields, a 3 character abbrieviation separated by a single "pipe" | character followed by the full name.

The zdata.players and zdata.races are just single field, 1 entry per line.
Blank lines are allowed, and are ignored.

All the zdata files shouldn't really need to be changed during a season.
Adding or deleting players or races would be about it


prediction and result files.
----------------------------
The WDC predicitions are stored in files named like :

wdc.leo
wdc.bill

the .leo , .bill file extension must match a player name in the zdata.players file.

The results for the wdc are stored in a file called :
wdc.results

Thus you can never have a player with the name of "results".

Blank lines will also be ignored in wdc.results or wdc.leo etc files.
again 1 entry per line.


WCC predictions are the same as WDC except stored in files named like

wcc.results
wcc.leo
wcc.bill


Race predictions are stored in files names like so :

bahrain.results
bahrain.leo
bahrain.bill

The results and prediction files must be in the order of prediction.
i.e. first place at the top of the file, last place at the bottom of the file.

====================================================

running the program, from within the directory just run :

./f1-predictor.pl --run (what you want to run it on)

the what you want to run it on is one of the following :

wdc
wcc
race-name  ( as it appears in the zdata.races )
