What's in the directories.
---------------------
Documents are here :

./docs
    quick user guide
    techie explanations

---------------------
This is where all the well "data" sits :

./data/
./data/2022

---------------------
This is where all the generated results are :

./output/
./output/2022/

./output/2022/winner-takes-all-simple.txt
./output/2022/winner-takes-all-detailed.txt

./output/2022/races-karl-8-and-positions-times-power-one-hundred

./output/2022/diff-and-positions-times-9-to-1
./output/2022/diff-and-position-no-multiplier

There should be a file all this,
but it has a special name of winner-takes-all-detailed :
./output/2022/exact-and-positions-times-power-one-hundred

./output/2022/exact-and-positions-times-25-to-8
./output/2022/exact-and-positions-times-9-to-1
./output/2022/exact-and-positions-no-multiplier


These directories are for dumps of the calculated results and data.
They're for anyone masochistic enougth to want to see things in say Excel spreadsheets (for CSV),
or for processing the data with their own script in the case of JSON
./output/2022/csv-dumps
./output/2022/json-dumps
(these directories are yet to appear on github, so Work-In-Progess )
