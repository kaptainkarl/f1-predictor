TODO things here.



change the options for the score-position-mulitplier to be one CLI option.
Add a new power-of-ten score-multiplier.


wcc and wdc probably need testing again. Might have bugs.
(lot of code change since last testing. Plus main script has been tweaked to really run on just 6 predictions from players)


Script is heavily tweaked for P1 -> P6 predictions only.
Some of the multipliers break badly if more predictions are done.
Script needs to die if one of these multipliers is selected, and there are more than P1 -> P6 predictions.



make the score-times-power-hundred NOT use the lookup hash.
do it with ** to-the-power-of operator.
The number of predictions will need to be limited because if there is ever a case where all 20 positions
are predicted the numbers would be so huge they'd almost certainly break perl integer number size limits.



substitute drivers ? Should they be ignored, ?
If someone picks a driver who then goes off sick (probably with covid) should the players
prediction of say VET at Bahrain just be substituted for HUL ?

Average Score table only calculated on players that have entered at least 50% of the rounds.


Output the individual races and totals tables in :
1) CSV
2) JSON
put this is a separate directory, otherwise there will be an explosion of files in one place (with all the different algorithms)
