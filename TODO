TODO things here.

Update the missing bits in algorithms_descriptions.


Allow sorting of the rounds table to be by multiple different scoring systems.
i.e. it could sort on the  exact-n-power-one-hundred score
and could also sort on a diff-n-power-one-hundred score.
This would get the Leo Winners Takes All exactly the same 99% of the time.
There are edge cases where counting "Did they have a pred in the Top 6" will not be the same.


finish the Totals Table "P" column switch off.
Also fix the P counting in the Totals table.
Currently joint scores , don't get the same P rating.


Add a new power-of-ten score-multiplier.


wcc and wdc probably need testing again. Might have bugs.
(lot of code change since last testing. Plus main script has been tweaked to really run on just 6 predictions from players)


Script is heavily tweaked for P1 -> P6 predictions only.
Some of the multipliers break badly if more predictions are done.
Script needs to die if one of these multipliers is selected, and there are more than P1 -> P6 predictions.



make the score-times-power-hundred NOT use the lookup hash.
do it with ** to-the-power-of operator.
The number of predictions will need to be limited because if there is ever a case where all 20 positions
are predicted the numbers would be so huge they'd almost certainly break perl integer number size limits.



substitute drivers ? Should they be ignored, ?
If someone picks a driver who then goes off sick (probably with covid) should the players
prediction of say VET at Bahrain just be substituted for HUL ?


Average Score table only calculated on players that have entered at least 50% of the rounds.

Do an Ave score table on FIA scores.


Output the individual races and totals tables in :
1) CSV
2) JSON
put this is a separate directory, otherwise there will be an explosion of files in one place (with all the different algorithms)
