This Doc describes how all the different combinations of algorithms work,
and the scoring works.

It also describes the Totals Tables.

OVERVIEW
--------

Some algorithms and scoring work well for say 10 to 30 players
Other algorithms work for many more players.
Some of the algorithms only work when predicting the top 6 positions.


The calculation of scores / ratings is done with 2 distinct parts.

First there is a score for the accuracy of the prediction.

Second, depending on the position of the prediction it is multiplied or not by a number.

That gives a player their score or rating on which a round of the competion is sorted on.


There is third part for JOKE tables , where fiddle factors can be applied to certain drivers. These are not used for serious competition tables.


--------------
ACCURACY part.
--------------
There are currently 5 different "accuracy" calculations called :

1) diff  or differential
2) karl-8
3) karl-32
4) karl-96-32
5) exact


diff or differential accuracy
-----------------------------

in F1 their are currently 20 drivers on the grid.

differential accuracy scores points by

20 - error-of-prediction = score

So if you go the position exactly correct then :

20 - 0 = 20 points.

if you got it 19 places out then :

20 - 1 = 19 points.

Sometimes drivers might be predicted who don't even make first practice.
If they are in a players prediction they will not be found in the results.
Then the player's score for that prediction will be 0 points.


Karl-8 accuracy
---------------

karl-8 also known as karl-8-4-2-1 scores points by

if prediction is exactly correct then 8 points
if prediction is 1 place  out 4 points
if prediction is 2 places out 2 points
if prediction is 3 places out 1 points

Again drivers predicted who don't even make first practice, they've not
even entered the race and don't end up on the official results, well 0 points.


Karl-32 accuracy
----------------

karl-32 also known as karl-32-16-8-4-2-1 scores points by

if prediction is exactly correct then 32 points
if prediction is 1 place  out 16 points
if prediction is 2 places out 8 points
if prediction is 3 places out 4 points
if prediction is 4 places out 2 points
if prediction is 5 places out 1 points

Again drivers predicted who don't even make first practice, they've not
even entered the race and don't end up on the official results, well 0 points.


Karl-96-16 accuracy
----------------

karl-96-16 also known as karl-96-16-8-4-2-1 scores points by

if prediction is exactly correct then 96 points
if prediction is 1 place  out 16 points
if prediction is 2 places out 8 points
if prediction is 3 places out 4 points
if prediction is 4 places out 2 points
if prediction is 5 places out 1 points

This very heavily weights exact predictions, thus the player who does most of those should win.

Again drivers predicted who don't even make first practice, they've not
even entered the race and don't end up on the official results, well 0 points.

Exact accuracy
--------------

The prediction has to be spot on to score 1 point.
everything else 0 points.

This is used in "Winner Takes All" all calculations.


----------------------
POSTIONAL MULTIPLIERS.
----------------------

position-times-power-one-hundred multiplier.
--------------------------------------------

Here the score from the ACCURACY part is multiplied by a number depending on the position of the prediction.

So the :

P1 prediction is multiplied by 10,000,000,000
P2 prediction is multiplied by    100,000,000
P3 prediction is multiplied by      1,000,000
P4 prediction is multiplied by         10,000
P5 prediction is multiplied by            100
P6 prediction is multiplied by              1


Most of the ACCURACY scores, well when not doing "fiddle factors" should be less than 100.
So what this multiplication achieves is a more accurate P1 score will trump everything else.
and a more accurate P2 score will trump the P3 -> P6

if you do have fiddle factors that can multiple the ACCURACY part above 100, then P1 accuracy might not trump all.

if you are doing more than 6 predictions, currently there isn't much point in using this multiplier.
It needs the code changing.


This multiplier is used in "Winner Takes All" calculations.
If fiddle factors have been applied then the "Winner Takes All" could and is likely to break. It will not really be "Winner Takes All".


About the tables output ...
---------------------------
When the tables are generated for the Power 100 type of multiplier, because it is 100 times bigger each column
the detail next to the driver position only usually shows 2 digits.

Say this excerpt from  ./output/2022/karl-32-and-positions-times-power-one-hundred-RACES

It can be seen that Ray has LEC with 32 points. In reality the score for this prediction is really 320,000,000,000
The score total at the end is split with commas on the hundreds instead of thousands,
so the individual scores for the positions can be seen.

positions-times-25-8 (25,18,15,12,10,8,6,4,2,1)
--------------------------------------------------

The 25-8 name comes from using on P1 -> P6 predictions. It can work up to 10 prediction positions.

So here the ACCURACY part is multiplied by :

P1  prediction is multiplied by 25
P2  prediction is multiplied by 18
P3  prediction is multiplied by 15
P4  prediction is multiplied by 12
P5  prediction is multiplied by 10
P6  prediction is multiplied by  8
P7  prediction is multiplied by  6
P8  prediction is multiplied by  4
P9  prediction is multiplied by  2
P10 prediction is multiplied by  1


positions-times-9-to-1 (9,6,4,3,2,1)
------------------------------------

This multiplier can work up to 6 prediction positions.

So here the ACCURACY part is multiplied by :

P1  prediction is multiplied by 9
P2  prediction is multiplied by 6
P3  prediction is multiplied by 4
P4  prediction is multiplied by 3
P5  prediction is multiplied by 2
P6  prediction is multiplied by 1


positions-times-1-to-9 (1,2,3,4,6,9)
------------------------------------

A reverse of 9-to-1. Who get's P5 and P6 more accurate more often ?

This multiplier can work up to 6 prediction positions.

So here the ACCURACY part is multiplied by :

P1  prediction is multiplied by 1
P2  prediction is multiplied by 2
P3  prediction is multiplied by 3
P4  prediction is multiplied by 4
P5  prediction is multiplied by 6
P6  prediction is multiplied by 9


positions-no-multiplier
-----------------------

The accuracy score isn't multiplied.
This will work up to the full 20 positions.


---------------------------------
FIDDLE FACTORS (Joke calculations
---------------------------------

The f1-predictor.pl script has a few options that can :

1) Multiply specific driver prediction by a number.
2) make a driver prediction score negative points.

The reasons you might use these are many.

Maybe you have a rule that if a driver causes a red flag, and it's their fault,
anyone who predicted that will have their score for that driver multiplied by a negative number.


Maybe a driver who has done an outstanding qualifying might have a positive fiddle factor applied to their score.


-----------
FIA Scoring
-----------

If you have a limited number of players, (say up to 20 to 30 )
you can choose to use FIA points on each round of the competition.

If you have a mass of players, it's probably best not to use this.

So a round of the championship will have the players results calculated by
the Accuracy x Multiplier part, the results will then be sorted.

The P1 winner will get 25 points , all the way to P10 with one point.


-------------
TOTALS tables
-------------

There are 5 types of totals table that sort the player order.
These are calculated when the f1-predictor.pl script is given more than 1 round to process.


1) Total of the scores worked out by Accuracy X Position-Multiplier


2) Total of the scores worked out by Accuracy X Position-Multiplier
    this is in reverse order.


3) Total up the FIA round scores


4) Average the Total scores over the rounds played by the player.
    This is for those players who might not have entered every round,
    and are thus at a disadvantage on the total scores table.


5) Round Position P1 -> P6 then Total score
    A player gets Positional ratings for each round.
    The P1 -> P6s are counted.
    The table is then sorted in the order of the most P1 , then P2s etc.
    It is finally sorted by total score

------------------------------------------
Perfect Scores of the Accuracy x Multipler
------------------------------------------

TODO : This needs updating with the new algorithm bits of "Karl-96-16" and "1-to-9" multiplier.

There are 4 different Accuracies and 4 different Multipliers. So 16 different combination.
So assuming only P1 -> P6 predictions, these are the perfect scores for 1 round of each combination.
