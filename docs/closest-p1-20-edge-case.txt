"Closest P1 20"  Slightly odd edge Case.
----------------------------------------------

The only 1 result that "troubles" me so far is what I've seen is below.

On positions 7 -> 9 on Enzo Sprint.



Closest-P1 ( only top 6 positions considered, the way Leo does it)
-----------
Leo only looks at the top 6 positions thus Bill, Karl and TLB would have all been equal.
They all had identical top 4 predictions, who all finished in the top 6.

The ALO, RUS and HAM predictions would have all been ignored , because they didn't finish in the top 6.

So they would have shared 3 FIA points , 3 ways. 1 point each.

I guess on lower points at P7->9 this isn't too much of an issue.
If the same kind of thing happened near P1 , more points would be won or lost,
with someone arguing "my predictions were better, more accurate, better order etc ..."


Just show P7 -> P9

Closest-P1-20
-------------

So In the Enzo Sprint the drivers in Karl, Bill and TLB's non top-6 predictions finished :

ALO P9
RUS P11
HAM P14

The closest-p1-20 looks at all 20 positions.

Karl's ALO 16 rates higher, because it was only 4 places out, and because ALO was closer to P1 than either RUS or HAM.
So that seems reasonable.

But Bill and TLB just have RUS and HAM swapped round.

Now RUS finished higher than HAM, so therefore the accuracy score for RUS trumps HAM.

Having RUS in P6 is more accurate than having RUS in P5.

So
TLB gets  RUS 15.
Bill gets RUS 14.

Therefore TLB by the closest-p1-20 algo is rated better.

But there is part of me thinking that Bill had their order more correct.

After all RUS did beat HAM.

This is real tight edge case. That is probably not worth worrying about.

I think the closest-p1-20 algo is the best so far. but I could see someone arguing that what it's produced below looks odd.
