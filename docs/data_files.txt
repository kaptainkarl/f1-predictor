===================================================
What are all the files about ?

zdata files
-----------

There are 4 "zdata" files.
Containing the specs of drivers, constructors, races and players.

all zdata files can have blank lines in them. Blank lines are ignored.

The zdata.drivers and zdata.constructors are 2 fields, a 3 character abbrieviation separated by a single "pipe" | character followed by the full name.

The zdata.players and zdata.races are just single field, 1 entry per line.
Blank lines are allowed, and are ignored.

All the zdata files shouldn't really need to be changed during a season.
Adding or deleting players or races would be about it

The zdata.players and the zdata.races entries should only be a-z , hyphens or underscores and be in lowercase. Spaces aren't allowed.
(this is because they're use for filing system lookup, and it's less painful this way)


prediction and result files.
----------------------------
All the players predictions are stored in a file named like :

wdc.all-players

The results for the wdc are stored in a file called :
wdc.results


Blank lines will also be ignored in wdc.results or wdc.all-players files.

WCC predictions are the same as WDC except stored in files named like

wcc.results
wcc.all-players

Race predictions are stored in files names like so :

bahrain-race.results
bahrain-race.all-players


The  .results files and .all-players have slightly different formats.

The .results file are on separate lines with P1 being the first line.
must be in the order of prediction.
i.e. first place at the top of the file, last place at the bottom of the file.

The .all-players file are in a format of :

player1: p1-driver-name, p2-driver-name, p3-driver-name ....
player2: p1-driver-name, p2-driver-name, p3-driver-name ....

====================================================
running the program, from within the directory just run :

./f1-predictor.pl --run (what you want to run it on)

--run can be a comma separated list of rounds , i.e.
    --run bahrain-race,bahrain-qual
(This is needed to make the totals table worthwhile reading)

the what you want to run it on is one of the following :

wdc
wcc
race-name or quali-name ( as it appears in the zdata.races )

=====================================================
The BEST scoring system

This seems to be --score-sys diff

with the position totals multiplied out by 9,6,4,3,2,1
this is the --score-times-1990

So command line options of :

--score-sys diff --score-times-1990
